"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"We are Bay Area journalists Lisa Krieger, Maggie Angst and Jose Carlos Fajardo. Ask us Anything about California's coronavirus outbreak!","Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering California’s coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Area’s and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

We’ve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

It’s been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. I’ve been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** I’m a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
